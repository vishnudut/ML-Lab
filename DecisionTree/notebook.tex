\subsection{Abstract:}\label{abstract}

Decision Tree algorithm belongs to the family of supervised learning
algorithms. Unlike other supervised learning algorithms, decision tree
algorithm can be used for solving regression and classification problems
too. The general motive of using Decision Tree is to create a training
model which can use to predict class or value of target variables by
learning decision rules inferred from prior data(training data).

The understanding level of Decision Trees algorithm is so easy compared
with other classification algorithms. The decision tree algorithm tries
to solve the problem, by using tree representation. Each internal node
of the tree corresponds to an attribute, and each leaf node corresponds
to a class label. Decision Tree Algorithm Pseudocode

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Place the best attribute of the dataset at the root of the tree.
\item
  Split the training set into subsets. Subsets should be made in such a
  way that each subset contains data with the same value for an
  attribute.
\item
  Repeat step 1 and step 2 on each subset until you find leaf nodes in
  all the branches of the tree.
\end{enumerate}

    \subsubsection{Introduction:}\label{introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Many organisations, nowadays, have developed their own databases, in
  which a large amount of valuable information, e.g., customers'
  personal profiles, is stored. Such information plays an important role
  in organisations' development processes as it can help them gain a
  better understanding of customers' needs. To effectively extract such
  information and identify hidden relationships, there is a need to
  employ intelligent techniques, for example, data mining.
\item
  Business Management In the past decades, many organizations had
  created their own databases to enhance their customer services.
  Decision trees are a possible way to extract useful information from
  databases and they have already been employed in many applications in
  the domain of business and management. In particular, decision tree
  modelling is widely used in customer relationship management and fraud
  detection, which are presented in subsections below.
\item
  Customer Relationship Management A frequently used approach to manage
  customers' relationships is to investigate how individuals access
  online services. Such an investigation is mainly performed by
  collecting and analyzing individuals' usage data and then providing
  recommendations based on the extracted information. Lee et al. (2007)
  apply decision trees to investigate the relationships between the
  customers' needs and preferences and the success of online shopping.
  In their study, the frequency of using online shopping is used as a
  label to classify users into two categories: (a) users who rarely used
  online shopping and (b) users who frequently used online shopping. In
  terms of the former, the model suggests that the time customers need
  to spend in a transaction and how urgent customers need to purchase a
  product are the most important factors which need to be considered.
  With respect to the latter, the created model indicates that price and
  the degree of human resources involved (e.g. the requirements of
  contacts with the employees of the company in having services) are the
  most important factors. The created decision trees also suggest that
  the success of an online shopping highly depends on the frequency of
  customers' purchases and the price of the products. Findings
  discovered by decision trees are useful for understanding their
  customers' needs and preferences
\item
  Fraudulent Statement Detection Another widely used business
  application is the detection of Fraudulent Financial Statements (FFS).
  Such an application is particularly important because the existence of
  FFS may result in reducing the government's tax income (Spathis et
  al., 2003). A traditional way to identify FFS is to employ statistical
  methods. However, it is difficult to discover all hidden information
  due to the necessity of making a huge number of assumptions and
  predefining the relationships among the large number of variables in a
  financial statement.
\item
  Previous research has proved that creating a decision tree is a
  possible way to address this issue as it can consider all variables
  during the model development process. Kirkos et al. (2007) have
  created a decision tree model to identify and detect FFS. In their
  study, 76 Greek manufacturing firms have been selected and their
  published financial statements, including balance sheets and income
  statements, have been collected for modelling purposes. The created
  tree model shows that all nonfraud cases and 92\% of the fraud cases
  have been correctly classified. Such a finding indicates that decision
  trees can make a significant contribution for the detection of FFS due
  to a highly accurate rate.
\end{enumerate}

Engineering The other important application domain that decision trees
can support is engineering. In particular, decision trees are widely
used in energy consumption and fault diagnosis, which are described in
subsections below. Energy Consumption Energy consumption concerns how
much electricity has been used by individuals. The investigation of
energy consumption becomes an important issue as it helps utility
companies identify the amount of energy needed. Although many existing
methods can be used for the investigation of energy consumption,
decision trees appear to be preferred. This is due to the fact that a
hierarchical structure provided by decision trees is useful to present
the deep level of information and insight. For instance, Tso and Yau
(2007) create a decision tree model to identify the relationships
between a household and its electricity consumptions in Hong Kong.
Findings from their tree model illustrate that the number of household
members are the most determinant factor of energy consumption in summer,
and both the number of air-conditioner and the size of a flat are the
second most important factors. In addition to such findings, their tree
model identifies that a household with four or more members with a flat
size larger than 817ft2 is the highest electricity consumption group. On
the other hand, households which have less than four family members and
without air-conditioners are the smallest electricity consumption group.
Such findings from decision trees not only provide a deeper insight of
the electricity consumptions within an area but also give guidelines to
electricity companies about the right time they need to generate more
electricity.

    \subsection{Methodology:}\label{methodology}

In decision trees, for predicting a class label for a record we start
from the root of the tree. We compare the values of the root attribute
with record's attribute. On the basis of comparison, we follow the
branch corresponding to that value and jump to the next node. We
continue comparing our record's attribute values with other internal
nodes of the tree until we reach a leaf node with predicted class value.
As we know how the modelled decision tree can be used to predict the
target class or the value. Now let's understanding how we can create the
decision tree model. Assumptions while creating Decision Tree

The below are the some of the assumptions we make while using Decision
tree: - At the beginning, the whole training set is considered as the
root. - Feature values are preferred to be categorical. If the values
are continuous then they are discretized prior to building the model. -
Records are distributed recursively on the basis of attribute values. -
Order to placing attributes as root or internal node of the tree is done
by using some statistical approach.

    The primary challenge in the decision tree implementation is to identify
which attributes do we need to consider as the root node and each level.
Handling this is know the attributes selection. We have different
attributes selection measure to identify the attribute which can be
considered as the root note at each level. The popular attribute
selection measures: - Information gain - Gini index Attributes Selection
If dataset consists of ``n'' attributes then deciding which attribute to
place at the root or at different levels of the tree as internal nodes
is a complicated step. By just randomly selecting any node to be the
root can't solve the issue. If we follow a random approach, it may give
us bad results with low accuracy. For solving this attribute selection
problem, researchers worked and devised some solutions. They suggested
using some criterion like information gain, gini index, etc. These
criterions will calculate values for every attribute. The values are
sorted, and attributes are placed in the tree by following the order
i.e., the attribute with a high value (in case of information gain) is
placed at the root. While using information Gain as a criterion, we
assume attributes to be categorical, and for gini index, attributes are
assumed to be continuous. Information Gain By using information gain as
a criterion, we try to estimate the information contained by each
attribute. We are going to use some points deducted from information
theory. To measure the randomness or uncertainty of a random variable X
is defined by Entropy. For a binary classification problem with only two
classes, positive and negative class. - If all examples are positive or
all are negative then entropy will be zero i.e, low. - If half of the
records are of positive class and half are of negative class then
entropy is one i.e, high.

By calculating entropy measure of each attribute, we can calculate their
information gain. Information Gain calculates the expected reduction in
entropy due to sorting on the attribute. Information gain can be
calculated. To get a clear understanding of calculating information gain
\& entropy, we will try to implement it on a sample data.

    \subsection{Dataset:}\label{dataset}

Given dataset is the wheatSeed dataset which has the following column

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  area
\item
  perimeter
\item
  compactness
\item
  lengthOfKernel
\item
  widthOfKernel
\item
  asymmetryCoefficient
\item
  lengthOfKernelGroove
\item
  TypeOfWheatSeed
\end{itemize}

We are going to apply logistic regression and try to figure out which
ones can be used to model a logistic regression model.
